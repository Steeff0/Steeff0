Hi I'm Steven from the Netherlands. I like to play with code. Now mainly focussing on CI/CD techniques and tools, like
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Jenkins
- GitHub Actions

I also dabble a bit with
- Java
- Gradle
- Scss (Bootstrap)

More about what I play with privately I post on [https://steeff0.github.io](https://steeff0.github.io )
